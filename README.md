# Ranking towns
In this project I want to analyze if a university town is affected by recession as much as a non-university town will be. 
A t-test will be used to compare the ratio of the mean housing price in the quarter of the recession bottom to the quarter before the start of the recession between a university
town and a non-university town.
This is an assignment given by online Coursera class.
